# Bootcamp Repository

## Folder Structure

- **homework/** → All homework contributions will be submitted here.
- **project/** → All project contributions will be submitted here.
- **class_materials/** → Local storage for class materials. Never pushed to
  GitHub.

## Homework Folder Rules

- Each homework will be in its own subfolder (`homework0`, `homework1`, etc.)
- Include all required files for grading.


# Project Purpose

This repository is a reproducible Python scaffold for my bootcamp project. It provides an isolated environment, organized folders for `data/`, `notebooks/`, and `src/`, a minimal configuration helper for environment variables, and a sanity-check notebook to confirm secrets and NumPy work correctly.


# [Your Project Title]

**Stage:** Problem Framing & Scoping (Stage 01)

## Problem Statement

[Write 1-2 paragraphs explaining:

- What specific problem you're solving
- Why it matters to stakeholders

- Usage Context: [when/how they'll use it]

## Useful Answer & Decision

- Analysis Type: [Descriptive/Predictive/Causal]
- Key Metrics: [what you'll measure]
- Deliverable: [what you'll create]

## Assumptions & Constraints
